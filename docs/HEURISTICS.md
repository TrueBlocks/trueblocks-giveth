Limiting Factors
====================
1.	How many levels deep can we dig?
	More than three? -- not sure

2.	How far back in time can we go?
	Back to Dec 2021 (infinite), one year (steady state), one month (too short?)

3.	How do we progress through exchanges
	- How do we know which addresses are exchanges?
	- How do we follow incoming sends which fan out dramatically?

4.	What is the smallest amount we care about?
	- 80% of all txs the amount of donation is less than 5$
	
5.	Can we simply ignore most tokens as they are not used?

Traffic
===============
  500 donations every two weeks? (maybe)
3,000 donations every two weeks? (six times bigger)
6,000 donations per month

In one month there are:
	43,200 minutes = 60 * 24 * 30
	2,532,000 seconds = 43,200 * 60
	one donation every 422 seconds = 2,532,000 / 6,000
	we have 422 seconds (7.0 minutes) to check for ciruclation
	should be enough for up to six times growth in traffic
