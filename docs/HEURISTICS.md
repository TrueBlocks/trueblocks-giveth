# Limiting Factors

- How many levels deep can we dig?
  - More than five? -- not sure

- How far back in time can we go?
  - Back to Dec 2021? Block zero), one year (steady state), one month (too short?)

- How do we progress through exchanges
  - How do we know which addresses are exchanges?
  - How do we follow incoming sends which fan out dramatically?

- What is the smallest amount we care about?
  - 80% of all txs the amount of donation is less than 5$

- Can we simply ignore most tokens as they are not used?

## Traffic

- 500 donations every two weeks? (maybe)
- 3,000 donations every two weeks? (six times bigger)
- 6,000 donations per month

- In one month there are:
  - 43,200 minutes = 60 * 24 * 30
  - 2,532,000 seconds = 43,200 * 60
  - one donation every 422 seconds = 2,532,000 / 6,000
  - we have 422 seconds (7.0 minutes) to check for ciruclation
  - should be enough for up to six times growth in traffic
