# trueblocks-giveth

This repo was used as part of this proposal to the Giveth forum: https://forum.giveth.io/t/proposal-monitoring-tool-to-help-identify-and-mitigate-recirculating-givbacks. The work entailed trying to identify, in an automated way, recirculated Givbacks. More information on this problem is here: https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks and in particular here: https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks/#disqualifying-factors-for-the-givbacks-program.

## Command Line Tool

We built a simple command line tool that currently allows us to download data from the Giveth APIs. While this is not all the data we need for the project, it's a start. We will documented the data structures [here](./data/QUESTIONS.md).

```
Data analysis for Giveth

  giveth [command]

Available Commands:
  data        Various routines to download and manipulate the data
  projects    Produces data related to the projects including addresses.tsv

  summarize   Summarizes and combines data by type and time period (i.e. rounds)

Flags:
  -r, --round uint   Limits the list of rounds to a single round
  -u, --update       If present, data commands pull data from Giveth's APIs
  -c, --script       If present, data commands generate bash script to query Giveth's APIs
  -s, --sleep uint   Instructs the tool how long to sleep between invocations
  -x, --fmt string   One of [json|csv|txt]
  -v, --verbose      If present, certain commands will display extra data

Use "giveth [command] --help" for more information about a command.
